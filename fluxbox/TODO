I didn't commit the styles that were in my local styles dir. None of the styles
were mine. I got'm from tenr.de ( http://tenr.de/styles/styles014.php?a=styles )

More specifically, the tarballs of all the styles he offers;
    http://tenr.de/files/tenr.de-styles-pkg.tar.bz2
    http://tenr.de/files/fluxmod-styles-pkg.tar.bz2

I want to try and create an overlay and add these style tarballs to it. I think
the fluxmod package is already available though;

[I] x11-themes/fluxbox-styles-fluxmod
     Available versions:  ~20040809 ~20041024 20050128 20050128-r1
     Installed versions:  20050128-r1(03:41:45 AM 03/22/2008)
     Homepage:            http://www.fluxmod.dk
     Description:         A collection of FluxBox themes from FluxMod

I'm not 100% sure it's the same package...
