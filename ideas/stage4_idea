What if we ran a virtual machine of a blank stage4?
"install" a stage4 tarball up to the point that you would normally set a root
pass and reboot. Now, we could set up a script/rails app that would create a 
chroot on the server. We would then scp/fuse/rsync that chroot onto the target
system. Would a chroot even be needed? Could we simply scp/fuse->copy/rsync
the running virtual machine? I guess what I'm thinking of is a "build server"
Also, this comes back to "installing" a flash based distro to a small partition
that you can boot into. Perhaps even install it to /boot you could run grub
from it, and boot whatever you sync to /

This is all rambaling at the moment. Will prolly be cleaned up by the time you 
read it.
