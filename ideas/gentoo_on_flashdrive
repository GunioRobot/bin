I didn't believe my friend when he told me how easy this is, and yet he was right!  From live CD image, to bootable USB key in only a few minutes!

Here's what I did, you may need to tweak it a bit for your setup.  Firstly I used one 1Gb USB key / thumbdrive / flashdrive / whatever, because I use the live CD image. You could use the minimal CD image and use a smaller key.  It appears to me as /dev/sdb.

0. dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=512 count=1

The reason I did this is because I had corrupted both the mbr and partition table of the usb key.  fdisk simply told me "unable to seek on /dev/sdb" and wouldn't continue.  Skip this step if you can fdisk ok.

1. fdisk -l; fdisk /dev/sdb; fdisk a partition!

I join these steps together, cause they're all related to creating the partition.  Make one partition covering the entire device.  Something like "n p 1   t 1 83 a 1 w" should do it.  Note I made it bootable, and I'm not using FAT.

2. mkfs.ext2 -L liveUSB /dev/sdb

You'll notice I'm using ext2 here.  Wait for the device to finish writing, then unplug and re-plug it, or mount it manually.

3. sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop /home/iain/Desktop/livecd-i686-installer-2008.0_beta2.iso /mnt/tmp/

There are multiple ways to do this.  This is the one I chose.

4. sudo rsync -avP /mnt/tmp/ /media/liveUSB

5. sudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/liveUSB --nofloppy /dev/sda

6. reboot!

Remember to set your BIOS to boot from your USB drive.  Now you have a live CD on a USB key.  Much nicer than burning!

YMMV.
