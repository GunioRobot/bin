So set up a website where there are groups of feeds that you can "tune in to" 
in miro. Each group of feeds will be treated as 1 channel. 

channels will have say all of the diggnation episodes. (would we have to store 
them?) So you pull up the diggnation channel, and you will see a guide. Look at
guide1.png. Top row is year, next row is month, next row is day of the week.

Allow users to add their own channels.

Should probably have a category system.
