I want to list good stuff to watch or lisen to
sub categories for each "genre"
there will be a tv_shows.conf for example
in tv_shows.conf there will be something like
S1E12-show_name /storage/show_name/show_name.mpg

So SeasonXEpisodeY and where on the filesystem it's located.

Hmmm thinking outloud here. What about doing m:/storage/ and g:/storage ?
Should prolly have m: and g: (or whatever identifiers we decide on) point
to the respective location. 

can even do it for say hulu links

I'm thinking we could eventually link it to a rails app that we could script 
up a tv on and could then "watch" tv on the puter.
