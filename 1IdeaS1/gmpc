It would be very nice if gmpc added the ability to write out tracks that it
organizes into their respective directories.

Example;

/music/f/FrankZappa/AlbumFoo/[tracks 1..13 of AlbumFoo,
tracks 1..10 of AlbumBar, and tracks 1..14AlbumBaz]

In gmpc's meta browser, it shows the albums in order, and I think
track info/song titles are based on id3tags and perhaps what is downloaded
from the internet?

I would like to be able to select tracks 1-10 of AlbumBar and maybe rt click
-> send to own dir or somesuch. 'send to dir' in general and letting the user
pick a dir to send the selected file(s) to  may be more useful.
