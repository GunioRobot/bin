## User configuration of the QoS script
##
## At a minimum, set the DOWNLOAD and UPLOAD variables below. Setting these
## slightly slower than the actual line speeds is critical to good QoS
## performance. With download and upload speeds set too high, the traffic queues
## in the modem (upload) and on the ISP side (download) will quickly fill up. As
## these queues can be very long --on the order of several seconds-- filling
## them will prohibit any meaningful traffic shaping.
##
## The default configuration, with the proper upload and download speeds set,
## should be adequate for most situations to separate out low-priority peer-to
## -peer traffic (eMule, Bittorrent, etc.) from interactive traffic such as web
## browsing and SSH sessions.
##
## The configuration can be refined by modifying the settings below. As an
## example, consider including support for VoIP. This may be accomplished by
## adding the IP address of a VoIP adapter to the IP_EXPR variable (e.g.
## IP_EXPR="192.168.1.10"). Doing so will elevate the status of traffic to and
## from the VoIP box to 'express'.
##
## In general, the configuration of the QoS script requires the setting of
## several variables. Most variables expect a space separated list of elements
## (ports, IP addresses, protocols). Adding an element to a list will, based on
## the variable name, either promote a certain connection to 'express' (highest
## priority) or 'priority' status, or demote it to 'bulk' status. The default
## status for all traffic is 'normal'. An example of setting a configuration
## variable to classify traffic is the statement
##
## TCP_PRIO="80 443"
##
## Including this line in the configuration will ensure that all TCP traffic to
## the listed ports (in this particular case for the http and https protocols)
## will be treated as 'priority' traffic.
##
## Another example (from the default configuration) is:
##
## TCP_BULK="1024: 21"
##
## which adds port 21 (the port used for ftp) and all ports 1024 and up to the
## list of destination ports for 'bulk' traffic. The result is that ftp
## downloads get a low priority, as does traffic to non-reserved ports (mostly
## peer-to-peer protocols). The notation '1024:' indicates a port range, in this
## case including all ports 1024 and higher. Another example of a port range is
## ':10' which means all ports from 0 to 10. A range from 10 to 20 is denoted as
## '10:20'.
##
## It is important to note that some variables take precedence over others. This
## becomes significant in cases where the same traffic is identified by
## different rules. An example is adding a UDP game port above 1024 to the
## express list. In the default configuration, all high ports (1024:) are
## included in the UDP_BULK variable. Without knowing the order of the rules, it
## is not possible to determine what the status of traffic to the game port will
## be. It turns out, the traffic will be classified as priority, since UDP_EXPR
## takes precedence over UDP_BULK.
##
## The order of the variables is (lowest precedence first): L7_BULK, L7_PRIO,
## L7_EXPR, IPP2P_BULK, IPP2P_PRIO, IPP2P_EXPR, TCP_BULK, UDP_BULK, TCP_PRIO,
## UDP_PRIO, TCP_EXPR, UDP_EXPR,  TOS_BULK, TOS_PRIO, TOS_EXPR, DSCP_BULK,
## DSCP_PRIO, DSCP_EXPR, IP_BULK, IP_PRIO, IP_EXPR
