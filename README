Lot's of junk scripts, doubt there useful to anyone but me. Lot of things like
gentoobugs.rb are used as hotkeys in openbox. Rest are either misc scripts I
wrote or am working on to do daily tasks. Couple of them I did not write
myself. Mainly the 256color test scripts. git-notpushed is another that comes
to mind.
