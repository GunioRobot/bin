V Tips

Now that we can read on to something functional. :) A few tips I picked up along the line.

* Vim has great help documentation. :help topic can be done on about anything.

* Vim has tab-completion for entering commands and bash-completion for files (e.g. :w ~/Desktop/myblog.txt)

* The mouse can be used in Vim for some functions, but it needs to be enabled. I use this setting as I find that moused in visual mode can be distractive.

set mouse=nic

    * To be able to select text with the mouse in this mode hold the shift key

A few other tips:

[[      start of the file
]]      end of the file

I       Insert at beginning of line
A       Append to end of line

Tab-mode rules:

vim -p doc1 doc2
gt      go through tabs
:tabnew To open new tab

Append a file:

:w >> ~/My-lousy-document

Check spelllinng:

:setlocal spell spelllang=en_us
:setlocal nospell
]s      next word
[s      previous word
z=      word suggestions

Spelling can be mapped to a key if used frequently enough, in my ~/.vimrc I mapped spelling the the F7 key:

map <F7> <Esc>:setlocal spell spelllang=en_us
map <S-F7> <Esc>:setlocal nospell
